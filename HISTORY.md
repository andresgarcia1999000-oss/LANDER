# Project History

## 2026-04-28 — Forked from Purisaki lander template
- Cloned the Purisaki lander framework (vanilla HTML + Vite + 4-language quiz funnel + Vercel webhook) as the starting template
- Stripped session artifacts: `.git`, `.vercel`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `gemini.md`, old `HISTORY.md`, `convo/`, `architecture/`, `tools/`, etc.
- Initialized fresh git repo
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the 1:1 swap checklist

## 2026-05-01 — GitHub remote configured (checklist item 1)
- Renamed local branch `master` → `main`
- Added GitHub remote: https://github.com/andresgarcia1999000-oss/LANDER
- Pushed initial commits to `origin/main`
- Note: `public/images/img5.mov` is 81 MB (above GitHub's 50 MB warning threshold) — pushed fine but flagged for future

## 2026-05-01 — Secrets file added
- Created `.env.local` (gitignored) with placeholder slots for every secret/config the swap checklist needs
- Updated `.gitignore` to also exclude `.env.local` and `.env.*.local` patterns
- Going forward: drop tokens/IDs in `.env.local` instead of pasting in chat

## 2026-05-01 — Trimmed to ES-only (checklist item 4)
- Deleted `pt/` and `fr/` lander folders
- Removed `pt` and `fr` entries from [vite.config.js](vite.config.js)
- Deleted orphaned per-language images: `logo-pt.{jpg,png}`, `logo-fr.jpg`, `product-box-pt.png`, `product-box-fr.jpg`, `form-chart-{pt,fr}.jpg`
- Build verified — produces `/` (default ES) and `/es` only
- Note: pt/fr branches still exist inside [src/main.js](src/main.js) language switch but are now dead — left untouched per CLAUDE.md rule

## 2026-05-01 — First Vercel deploy + custom domain (checklist items 2 & 3)
- Created Vercel project `omar` under team `omars-projects-61a04961`
- Deployed to prod: https://omar-puce.vercel.app
- Attached custom domain `dietreviewhub.com` (registered through Vercel — nameservers already pointing to ns1/ns2.vercel-dns.com, no registrar changes needed)
- Verified: `https://dietreviewhub.com` returns HTTP 200 via Vercel edge
- ⚠ Content is still 100% Purisaki — RedTrack tracker, click-out URL, webhook, product imagery, copy all need swapping (checklist items 5–15)
- ⚠ `WEBHOOK_URL` env var not yet set in Vercel — quiz submissions will fail until it is

## 2026-05-01 — Old-domain sweep (checklist items 7 & 8 — partial)
- Added Vercel DNS CNAME `trk.dietreviewhub.com` → `qm9iv.ttrk.io` (RedTrack edge); RedTrack SSL provisioning
- Swapped tracker host in `<head>` of `index.html` and `es/index.html`: `trk.yourdietreviews.com` → `trk.dietreviewhub.com`
- Cleared old default campaign ID from both tracker init scripts: `defaultcampaignid=` is now blank
- Replaced offer button `href` from `https://trk.yourdietreviews.com/click` → `#` in both files (inert until real CLICKOUT_URL provided)
- Updated CLAUDE.md items 7 & 8 to reflect new state
- Verified `grep` finds zero remaining occurrences of `yourdietreviews` or any old campaign ID across the project
- Build clean, redeployed to prod, dietreviewhub.com aliased to new deployment
- ⚠ Still pending from user: `REDTRACK_CAMPAIGN_ID_ES`, `CLICKOUT_URL`, `WEBHOOK_URL`

## 2026-05-01 — RedTrack pixel wired up for ES (checklist item 7 — ES done)
- Replaced tracker init script in both `index.html` and `es/index.html`:
  - script filename: `unilpclick.js` → `uniclick.js` (the old account used a different RedTrack script variant)
  - `defaultcampaignid` filled in: `69f4fe9a187f0de37aedddeb`
  - removed `async` attribute per RedTrack-provided snippet (loads synchronously)
- Saved `REDTRACK_HOST=trk.dietreviewhub.com` and `REDTRACK_CAMPAIGN_ID_ES=69f4fe9a187f0de37aedddeb` in `.env.local`
- Build clean, redeployed to prod
- ⚠ Still pending: `CLICKOUT_URL` (offer button still inert) and `WEBHOOK_URL` (quiz submissions still fail)

## 2026-05-01 — Click-out URL wired in (checklist item 8 done)
- Set offer button `href` in both `index.html` and `es/index.html` to `https://trk.dietreviewhub.com/click`
- The `/click` endpoint relies on the cookie set by the `uniclick.js` pixel on lander load — RedTrack will read the click ID + campaign from the cookie and redirect to the offer
- SSL cert on `trk.dietreviewhub.com` issued by Let's Encrypt (notAfter Jul 30 2026); HTTPS confirmed working
- Saved `CLICKOUT_URL` to `.env.local`
- Build clean, redeployed to prod
- ⚠ Still pending: `WEBHOOK_URL` for quiz submissions (must be set in Vercel dashboard env var, not just `.env.local`)
- Note: 2 other `href="#"` links remain in each lander (inline "tienda oficial" link line 226, footer legal links line 278) — they were `#` in the original Purisaki template too, intentionally not changed; will need real legal page URLs eventually
